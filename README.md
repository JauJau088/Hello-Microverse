# Hello Microverse

> Hello Microverse project is the first solo project that Micronauts have to do. It's introduced on the second day of the program. This project teaches Git, GitHub, GitHub Flow, and linters - all in order to familiarize with web development best practices such as good coding habits and repository professionalism from early on!


## Built With

- HTML, CSS
- Linters: Lighthouse, Webhint, Stylelint


## Getting Started

The website will be able to run perfectly just by cloning this repository and put it on your local computer without the need of extra steps. However, in order to be able to do the linter tests on your local machine, you need to follow these simple steps:


### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- npm installed

### Setup

The Linters that we are using here are Lighthouse, Webhint, and Stylelint. [This documentation here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css) shows you in great details how to set them up properly on you local machine.
